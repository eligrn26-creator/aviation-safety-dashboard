# Aviation Safety Portfolio

This portfolio showcases modular analytics tools designed to support aviation safety decision-making. Each artifact is built for clarity, reproducibility, and operational impact.

## 1. SMS-Relevant Accident Trends

**Purpose:**  
Flags aviation accidents using domain-specific SMS keywords (e.g., fatigue, hydraulic failure, checklist omission).  
**Features:**  
- Keyword-based domain flagging across Human, Mechanical, Environmental, Operational, and Procedural categories  
- Faceted visualizations by operator type and year  
- Narrative insights for audit readiness and safety storytelling

**Files:**  
- `SMS-Relevant-Accident-Trends.Rmd` – source code  
- `SMS-Relevant-Accident-Trends.html` – rendered report

## 2. Injury Severity Dashboard

**Purpose:**  
Analyzes accident data segmented by injury severity (Fatal, Serious, Minor).  
**Features:**  
- Year-over-year trends by operator type  
- Visual breakdown of severity across regions  
- Foundation for integrating aircraft type, weather, and SMS flags

**Files:**  
- `injury_dashboard.Rmd` – source code
